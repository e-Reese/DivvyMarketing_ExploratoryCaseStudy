# Differences in how cyclists use Divvy bikes
This repo contains the code for my analysis on how Divvy (a bike-sharing company in Chicago) can use the differences between subscribed and non-subscribed cyclists use of Divvy bikes 
to better market to non-subscribing customers and convert them to subscribers. To replicate this analysis, please run ['BikeShare_DataSetup.Rmd'](https://github.com/e-Reese/DivvyMarketing_ExploratoryCaseStudy/blob/main/BikeShare_DataSetup.Rmd).
