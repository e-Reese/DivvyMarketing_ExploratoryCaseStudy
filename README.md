# Differences in how cyclists use Divvy bikes
This repo contains the code for my analysis on how Divvy (a bike-sharing company in Chicago) can use the differences between subscribed and non-subscribed cyclists' use of Divvy bikes 
to better market to non-subscribing customers and convert them to subscribers. To replicate this analysis, please run ['BikeShare_DataSetup.Rmd'](https://github.com/e-Reese/DivvyMarketing_ExploratoryCaseStudy/blob/main/BikeShare_DataSetup.Rmd).

A slide presentation of my report can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lF3xD_C3I-1FnUPe26OEGgCbmnA_6NXxu1_tk0Lldjc/edit?usp=sharing).

Please be advised that this report was ran with data from March 2023 to February 2024, was created March 28 2024, and is no longer updated. The data used came from [Divvy's open data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
